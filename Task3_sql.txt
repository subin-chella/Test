Given the following tables:

create table user(
   name varchar(20),
   email varchar(40),
   role varchar(20));

create table role(
   name varchar(20),
   level number(10));


1. create a query to list all users and emails
2. create a query to list all users and emails that have a non-existing role
3. create a query to list all roles ordered by how many users have that role
   (so if there are 1 'ceo', 2 'board member', 5 'manager' and 10 'developer', you should get

   developer    10
   manager      5
   board member 2
   ceo          1
