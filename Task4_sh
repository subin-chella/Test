1. write the commands needed to list the files for the user test in the project1 folder

2. list all projects that have a revised plan (for any user)
        (in this case, it should print "project2" and "project3")

3. create a folder /home/test2/files and create 10 empty files inside it, with the
   file names 1.txt, 2.txt, ... 10.txt
